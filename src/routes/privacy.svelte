        Some of our Website contain links to the YouTube platform. In general,
        we are not responsible for the content of websites to which links are

        to point out that YouTube stores the data of its users (e.g. personal

      <p class="mb-4">
        On our Website we also integrate videos stored on YouTube directly. In
        this integration, content from the YouTube website is displayed in
        sub-areas of a browser window. However, YouTube videos are only accessed
        by clicking on them separately. This technique is also called ‘framing’.
        If you click on a (sub-)page of our Website where YouTube videos are

        content is displayed on the Website by notifying your browser.

        YouTube content is only integrated in the ‘extended data protection

        does not initially store any cookies on your device. However, when you
        access the relevant pages, the IP address and the other data are
        processed by Youtube. However, this information cannot be assigned to

      <p class="mb-4">
        As soon as you click on an integrated video, YouTube only stores cookies
        on your device that do not contain any personally identifiable data,
        unless you are currently logged in to a Google service. These cookies
        can be prevented by appropriate browser settings and extensions (see

        Profiling means any automated processing of personal data consisting in
        the use of such personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects
        relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict
        aspects relating to the performance of work, economic situation, health,
        personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or
        relocation of that natural person. Examples of such profiling include
        the analysis of data (e.g. based on statistical methods) with the aim of
        displaying personalized advertising to the user or giving shopping tips.
        The data subject shall not be subject to a decision based exclusively on
        automated processing, including profiling, which has legal effect
        against him or significantly affects him or her in a similar manner.

      </h2>

      <h3 class="mx-0 my-4">Duration of Storing your Data</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        As a rule, we only store your personal data for as long as it is
        necessary for the execution of the contract or the respective purpose
        and limit the storage period to an absolutely necessary minimum. Your
        IP-address and server-log-files (as set forth above) are stored for
        seven (7) days for security and technical reasons.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        In the case of long-term contractual relationships, such as the use of
        our Service, these storage periods may vary, but are generally limited
        to the duration of the contractual relationship or, with regard to the
        inventory data, to the maximum legal retention periods, e.g. in
        accordance with the German Commercial Code <em
          >(Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB)</em
        >
        and the Tax Code
        <em>(Abgabenordnung, AO)</em>
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Criteria for the storage period include whether the data are still
        up-to-date, whether the contractual relationship with us still exists,
        whether an inquiry has already been processed, whether a process has
        been completed or not, and whether legal retention periods for the
        personal data concerned are relevant or not.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mx-0 my-4">Data Security</h3>
