# Configure Gitpod

With Gitpod, you can open any repository by prefixing its URL with `gitpod.io/#` - no configuration necessary. This is great to review code or quickly browse an open source project in a familiar environment where your favourite keyboard shortcuts are available.

To get the most out of Gitpod though, you can create a [`.gitpod.yml`](/docs/config-gitpod-file) configuration file at the root of your project to provide Gitpod with instructions on how to build and prepare the developer environment specifically for a project.

The chapters in this section provide details on what you can configure.
