## Installing the .NET Tools

To get all the .NET tools that you need pre-installed in your Gitpod workspaces, use the following base image in your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/config-gitpod-file):

```YAML
image: gitpod/workspace-dotnet
```

If your project requires a GUI or Virtual Desktop, please use this image instead:

```YAML
image: gitpod/workspace-dotnet-vnc
```

This will give you a full GUI Virtual Desktop for your .NET application! The Virtual Desktop will be running on port `6080`.

## Compiling .NET Code in Gitpod

To compile your **C#** or **F#** Code in Gitpod, run `dotnet build <FILE>`, where `<FILE>` is the path to the C# or F# project file or .NET solution file you want to compile.

## Running .NET Code in Gitpod

To run your code after it has been compiled run `dotnet <FILE>` where `<FILE>` is the path to the EXE file you want to run. You can also run application with `dotnet run <FILE>` where `<FILE>` is the path to the C# or F# project file you want to compile and run.

## Running .NET Code in watch-mode

Alternatively, you can also run your application in so-called watch-mode. In such configuration the application will recompile and rerun itself every time you save any source file belonging to the project. To run your code in watch-mode use `dotnet watch --project <FILE> run` where `<FILE>` is the path to the C# or F# project file you want to compile and run.

## Useful VSCode Extensions

### C#

The official C# extension from Microsoft [is proprietary](https://aka.ms/VSCode-DotNet-DbgLicense) and unfortunately cannot be used. The MIT licensed [muhammad-sammy.csharp](https://open-vsx.org/extension/muhammad-sammy/csharp) extension from Samsung brings code completion, snippets, auto-formatting, peek definition, refactoring, hover documentation and breakpoint debugging for C# however!

![C# Extension Demo](../../../static/images/docs/CSharpDemo.png)

To add this extension to your repository, add the following to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/config-gitpod-file):

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - muhammad-sammy.csharp
```

### F#

The [Ionide-fsharp](https://ionide.io/) extensin gives F# developers the following features:

- A Widget for your F# needs
- Auto completion
- Shows errors inline
- Quickfix
- Goto definition
- Peek definition
- And more...

![Ionide fsharp Example](../../../static/images/docs/Iondine_Example.png)
